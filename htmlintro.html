        <h2>Introduction to HTML</h2>
        <p>
          HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to
          create web pages. It serves as the backbone of web content, providing
          the basic structure for documents on the internet. HTML uses a system
          of tags and elements to format text, embed images, create links, and
          define the layout of web pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          With HTML, you can easily create structured documents that include
          headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and more. The language is
          essential for web development, as it allows browsers to render and
          display content in a user-friendly way. HTML is often used in
          conjunction with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for styling and
          JavaScript for interactivity, making it a fundamental skill for web
          developers and designers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, understanding HTML is crucial for anyone interested in
          building websites or working in the field of web development, as it
          lays the foundation for more advanced web technologies.

        <h2>What is an HTML Element?</h2>
        <p>
          An HTML element is a component of an HTML document that defines the
          structure and content of the page. Elements are represented by tags,
          which are enclosed in angle brackets. For example, the
          <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag defines a paragraph element. Each element
          typically consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Some
          elements, like <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> for a line break, are
          self-closing and do not require a closing tag.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML elements can also have attributes that provide additional
          information about the element. For instance, the
          <code>src</code> attribute in an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag
          specifies the source of the image to be displayed.
        </p>

        <h2>History of HTML</h2>
        <p>
          HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 as a way to format and
          link documents on the World Wide Web. The first version of HTML was
          simple and focused primarily on text formatting and hyperlinking. Over
          the years, HTML has evolved significantly, with various versions
          introducing new features and capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML 2.0 was released in 1995, followed by HTML 3.2 in 1997 and HTML
          4.01 in 1999, which included support for multimedia elements and
          improved accessibility features. In 2014, HTML5 was published,
          bringing many modern features such as audio and video support, new
          semantic elements, and improved parsing rules, making it easier for
          developers to create complex web applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML continues to be actively developed, with ongoing updates to
          enhance its functionality and usability for developers and users
          alike.

    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;

        &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;

        <section id="explanation">
          <h2>Explanation of Each Tag in HTML Document</h2>
          <h4>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</h4>
          <p>This is the document type declaration. 
            It tells the browser that this is an HTML5 document, the latest standard of HTML. 
            It ensures that the browser renders the HTML according to HTML5 rules.</p>
            <h4>&lt;html lang="en"&gt;</h4>
            <p>This is the root element of an HTML document, indicating the start of the HTML code.<br>
              The lang="en" attribute specifies the document’s language as English. 
              This is helpful for search engines and accessibility tools (like screen readers) to understand the language of the page.</p>
              <h4>&lt;head&gt;</h4>
              <p>This tag contains metadata (information about the document that is not displayed on the page) and links to external resources.
                Elements inside &lt;head&gt; don’t appear on the page itself but affect how the page is displayed and accessed.</p>
                <h4>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</h4>
                <p>Specifies the character encoding for the HTML document, with UTF-8 being the most widely used. 
                  It supports almost all characters from different languages, ensuring that text is displayed correctly.</p>
                  <h4> &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;</h4>
                  <p>This tag helps ensure the webpage is responsive on mobile devices.
                    width=device-width tells the browser to match the width of the screen, and initial-scale=1.0 sets the initial zoom level.
                     These attributes make the page more mobile-friendly.</p>
                     <h4>&lt;title&gt;</h4>
                     <p>Defines the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser tab and is used as the page title in search engine results. 
                      The &lt;title&gt; tag is essential for SEO and usability.</p>
                      <h4>&lt;body&gt;</h4>
                      <p>Contains the main content of the webpage, everything that will be visible in the browser.
                        All visible elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links are placed within the &lt;body&gt; tag.</p>
                        <h4>&lt;h1&gt;</h4>
                        <p>This is a heading tag, specifically the top-level heading. HTML offers six heading levels, from &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;, with &lt;h1&gt; being the most important and &lt;h6&gt; the least.
                          &lt;h1&gt; is often used for the main title of the page or a major section, as search engines and accessibility tools treat it as an important label for the content.</p>
                          <h4>&lt;p&gt;</h4>
                          <p>Defines a paragraph of text. The &lt;p&gt; tag is used for regular body text within sections of the page.
                            Paragraph tags add spacing before and after each block of text for readability.</p>
                            <h4>&lt;/html&gt;</h4>
                            <p>This closing tag marks the end of the HTML document.
                              All content of the webpage should be placed inside this &lt;html&gt; root tag to ensure correct rendering.</p>
